# A transformer enters the Y-bus through a complex tap $t = a\,e^{j\varphi}$.
# The ratio $a$ moves voltage, the phase shift $\varphi$ moves active power.
# For the series recursion of APSLF a phase-shifting transformer (PST) is
# special: it drives a circulating current even when all bus voltages are
# equal, so the flat germ of the basic method is no longer an exact
# order-0 solution, and the Y-bus is no longer symmetric. This notebook
# builds the branch model, shows the problem on the row sums, works the two
# consistent embeddings of theory Section 6.5 by hand on a 4-bus network,
# and then uses the built-in kernels for an angle sweep and a regulated PST.

#nb # ## Setup (Colab)
#nb # This cell installs AnalyticLoadFlow from GitHub (branch `main`) into a
#nb # fresh temporary environment. Run it first, once per session. To test a
#nb # branch, change `rev`. For a private checkout use a personal access token:
#nb # `Pkg.add(url = "https://USER:TOKEN@github.com/USER/AnalyticLoadFlow.jl", rev = "main")`.
#nb using Pkg
#nb Pkg.activate(temp = true)
#nb Pkg.add(url = "https://github.com/SOPTIM/AnalyticLoadFlow.jl", rev = "main")
#nb # For the latest registered release use: Pkg.add("AnalyticLoadFlow")

# ## 1. The branch model
#
# With series admittance $y = 1/(r + jx)$ and tap $t$ on side $i$ the branch
# contributes (theory Section 6.5)
#
# ```math
# I_i = \frac{y}{|t|^2} V_i - \frac{y}{\bar t} V_k, \qquad
# I_k = -\frac{y}{t} V_i + y V_k .
# ```
#
# [`transformer_branch`](@ref) stores the parameters, [`branch_admittances`](@ref)
# returns the four entries. For a pure phase shifter $|t| = 1$: the diagonal
# entries are unchanged, the off-diagonal entries pick up $e^{\pm j\varphi}$.

# ## 2. What the PST does to the germ
#
# The flat germ rests on zero row sums: with all voltages equal, $Y\mathbf{1}$
# is the current vector, and it must vanish. A transformer at nominal tap
# has zero row sums, a PST does not. `build_ybus(...; nominal = true)`
# returns the matrix with every tap forced to $1\angle 0°$ and shunts
# removed, which is the $Y_0$ of Section 6.5.

# method, changes the angle and re-runs APSLF (theory Section 6.5).
